# StatTag
StatTag is a free plug-in for conducting reproducible research and creating dynamic documents using Microsoft Word with the 
R, Stata and SAS statistical packages.

StatTag allows users to embed statistical output (estimates, tables, and figures) within Word and provides an interface to 
edit statistical code directly from Word. Statistical output can be individually or collectively updated from Word in one-click 
with a behind-the-scenes call to the statistical program. With StatTag, modification of a dataset or analysis no longer entails 
transcribing or re-copying results in to a manuscript or table.
